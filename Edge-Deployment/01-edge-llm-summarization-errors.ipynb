    "### Helm Deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "Published pipelines can be deployed through the use of helm charts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Helm deployments take up to two steps - the first step is in retrieving the required `values.yaml` and making updates to override.\n",
    "\n",
    "Kubernetes provides persistent volume support, so no settings are required.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Pull the helm charts from the published pipeline.  The two fields are the Helm Chart URL and the Helm Chart version to specify the OCI .    This typically takes the format of:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```bash\n",
    "  helm pull oci://{published.helm_chart_url} --version {published.helm_chart_version}\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Extract the `tgz` file and copy the `values.yaml` and copy the values used to edit engine allocations, etc.  The following are **required** for the deployment to run:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```yml\n",
    "  ociRegistry:\n",
    "    registry: {your registry service}\n",
    "    username:  {registry username here}\n",
    "    password: {registry token here}\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  Store this into another file, suc as `local-values.yaml`.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create the namespace to deploy the pipeline to.  For example, the namespace `wallaroo-edge-pipeline` would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```bash\n",
    "  kubectl create -n wallaroo-edge-pipeline\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Deploy the `helm` installation with `helm install` through one of the following options:\n",
    "    1. Specify the `tgz` file that was downloaded and the local values file.  For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "        ```bash\n",
    "        helm install --namespace {namespace} --values {local values file} {helm install name} {tgz path}\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Specify the expended directory from the downloaded `tgz` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "        ```bash\n",
    "        helm install --namespace {namespace} --values {local values file} {helm install name} {helm directory path}\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Specify the Helm Pipeline Helm Chart and the Pipeline Helm Version.\n",
    "\n",
    "        ```bash\n",
    "        helm install --namespace {namespace} --values {local values file} {helm install name} oci://{published.helm_chart_url} --version {published.helm_chart_version}\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Once deployed, the DevOps engineer will have to forward the appropriate ports to the `svc/engine-svc` service in the specific pipeline.  For example, using `kubectl port-forward` to the namespace `ccfraud` that would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    kubectl port-forward svc/engine-svc -n ccfraud01 8080 --address 0.0.0.0`\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "The following code segment generates a `docker run` template based on the previously published pipeline.  Replace the `$REGISTRYURL`, `$REGISTRYUSERNAME`, and `$REGISTRYPASSWORD` to match the OCI Registry being used."
