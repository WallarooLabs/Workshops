    "| Orchestration | ML Workload orchestration allows data scientists and ML Engineers to automate and scale production ML workflows in Wallaroo to ensure a tight feedback loop and continuous tuning of models from training to production. Wallaroo platform users (data scientists or ML Engineers) have the ability to deploy, automate and scale recurring batch production ML workloads that can ingest data from predefined data sources to run inferences in Wallaroo, chain pipelines, and send inference results to predefined destinations to analyze model insights and assess business outcomes. |\n",
    "| Task | An implementation of an Orchestration.  Tasks can be either `Run Once`:  They run once and upon completion, stop. `Run Scheduled`: The task runs whenever a specific `cron` like schedule is reached.  Scheduled tasks will run until the `kill` command is issued. |\n",
    "| Task Run | The execusion of a task.  For `Run Once` tasks, there will be only one `Run Task`.  A `Run Scheduled` tasks will have multiple tasks, one for every time the schedule parameter is met.  Task Runs have their own log files that can be examined to track progress and results. |"
