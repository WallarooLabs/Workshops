    "# Workshop Notebook 7: Deploy Pipeline to Edge Devices\n",
    "\n",
    "For this workshop, we will take a Wallaroo pipeline and publish it to an Open Container (OCI) Registry.  The registry details are stored in the Wallaroo instance as the Edge Registry.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this set of exercises, you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use a pre-trained model and deploy it to Wallaroo.\n",
    "1. Perform sample inferences.\n",
    "1. Publish the pipeline to the Edge Registry.\n",
    "1. See the steps to deploy the published pipeline to an Edge device and perform inferences through it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deployment to the Edge allows data scientists to work in Wallaroo to test their models in Wallaroo, then once satisfied with the results publish those pipelines.  DevOps engineers then take those published pipeline details from the Edge registry and deploy them into Docker and Kubernetes environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "This workshop will demonstrate the following concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Wallaroo Workspaces](https://docs.wallaroo.ai/wallaroo-developer-guides/wallaroo-sdk-guides/wallaroo-sdk-essentials-guide/wallaroo-sdk-essentials-workspace/):  Workspaces are environments were users upload models, create pipelines and other artifacts.  The workspace should be considered the fundamental area where work is done.  Workspaces are shared with other users to give them access to the same models, pipelines, etc.\n",
    "* [Wallaroo Model Upload and Registration](https://docs.wallaroo.ai/wallaroo-developer-guides/wallaroo-sdk-guides/wallaroo-sdk-essentials-guide/wallaroo-sdk-model-uploads/): ML Models are uploaded to Wallaroo through the SDK or the MLOps API to a **workspace**.  ML models include default runtimes (ONNX, Python Step, and TensorFlow) that are run directly through the Wallaroo engine, and containerized runtimes (Hugging Face, PyTorch, etc) that are run through in a container through the Wallaroo engine.\n",
    "* [Wallaroo Pipelines](https://docs.wallaroo.ai/wallaroo-developer-guides/wallaroo-sdk-guides/wallaroo-sdk-essentials-guide/wallaroo-sdk-essentials-pipelines/): Pipelines are used to deploy models for inferencing.  Each model is a **pipeline step** in a pipelines, where the inputs of the previous step are fed into the next.  Pipeline steps can be ML models, Python scripts, or Arbitrary Python (these contain necessary models and artifacts for running a model).\n",
    "* [Pipeline Edge Publication](https://staging.docs.wallaroo.ai/wallaroo-developer-guides/wallaroo-sdk-guides/wallaroo-sdk-essentials-guide/wallaroo-sdk-essentials-pipelines/wallaroo-sdk-essentials-pipeline-publication/): How to publish a Wallaroo pipeline to an OCI registry, then deploy that pipeline into other environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this tutorial, we will be providing pre-trained models in ONNX format, and have connected a sample Edge Registry to our Wallaroo instance.\n",

    "## Deploy a Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we reach what we've been aiming for:  deploying a pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "By now, you've seen how workspaces contain the models, pipelines, and other artifacts.  You've uploaded a model and retrieved the latest version of the model.  You've built a pipeline and added the model version as a pipeline step.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we will deploy the pipeline.  Deploying a pipeline allocated resources from the cluster to that pipeline for it's use.  The amount of resources has a default value of 4 CPUs, but for this workshop we'll be adjusting that to just 0.5 cpus and 1 GB RAM per pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **IMPORTANT NOTE**:  Please stick to these resource configurations when using a Wallaroo instance with other users.  Otherwise, pipelines might not deploy if the available resources are used up.\n",
    "\n",
    "To deploy a pipeline, we do two things:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Create a deployment configuration: This is an optional step, but we will make it mandatory for this workshop to allow other users to work in the same Wallaroo instance without running out of resources.\n",
    "* Deploy the pipeline with the deployment configuration:  This is the active step that saves the pipeline steps, and allocates system resources to the pipeline for performing inferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deployment configurations are made with the `wallaroo.DeploymentConfigBuilder()` class, and then we assign the resource settings from there.  This is saved to a variable so we can apply it to our pipeline deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of setting up a deployment with just 0.5 cpu and 1Gi RAM:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "deploy_config = wallaroo.DeploymentConfigBuilder().replica_count(1).cpus(0.5).memory(\"1Gi\").build()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice the `replica_count(1)` configuration - this tells Wallaroo to only spin up one replica for this pipeline.  In a production environment, we could spin multiple replicas either manually or automatically as more resources are needed to improve performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we deploy the pipeline with our deployment configuration with the `wallaroo.pipeline.deploy(deploy_configuration)` method.  If our pipeline variable is `my_pipeline`, then we would deploy it as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "deploy_config = wallaroo.DeploymentConfigBuilder().replica_count(1).cpus(0.5).memory(\"1Gi\").build()\n",
    "my_pipeline.deploy(deployment_config=deploy_config)\n",
    "```\n",
