The python step takes that data and adds the additional field `avg_conf`, which is an average of the `confidences` fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deploying the pipeline means that resources from the cluster are allocated to the pipeline, and it is ready to accept inferences. You can \"turn off\" the pipeline with the call `pipeline.undeploy()`, which returns the resources back to the cluster.
