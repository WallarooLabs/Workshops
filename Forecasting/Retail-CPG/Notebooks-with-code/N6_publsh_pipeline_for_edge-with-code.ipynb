    "# Workshop Notebook 7: Deploy Pipeline to Edge Devices\n",
    "\n",
    "For this workshop, we will take a Wallaroo pipeline and publish it to an Open Container (OCI) Registry.  The registry details are stored in the Wallaroo instance as the Edge Registry.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this set of exercises, you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use a pre-trained model and deploy it to Wallaroo.\n",
    "1. Perform sample inferences.\n",
    "1. Publish the pipeline to the Edge Registry.\n",
    "1. See the steps to deploy the published pipeline to an Edge device and perform inferences through it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deployment to the Edge allows data scientists to work in Wallaroo to test their models in Wallaroo, then once satisfied with the results publish those pipelines.  DevOps engineers then take those published pipeline details from the Edge registry and deploy them into Docker and Kubernetes environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "This workshop will demonstrate the following concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Wallaroo Workspaces](https://docs.wallaroo.ai/wallaroo-developer-guides/wallaroo-sdk-guides/wallaroo-sdk-essentials-guide/wallaroo-sdk-essentials-workspace/):  Workspaces are environments were users upload models, create pipelines and other artifacts.  The workspace should be considered the fundamental area where work is done.  Workspaces are shared with other users to give them access to the same models, pipelines, etc.\n",
    "* [Wallaroo Model Upload and Registration](https://docs.wallaroo.ai/wallaroo-developer-guides/wallaroo-sdk-guides/wallaroo-sdk-essentials-guide/wallaroo-sdk-model-uploads/): ML Models are uploaded to Wallaroo through the SDK or the MLOps API to a **workspace**.  ML models include default runtimes (ONNX, Python Step, and TensorFlow) that are run directly through the Wallaroo engine, and containerized runtimes (Hugging Face, PyTorch, etc) that are run through in a container through the Wallaroo engine.\n",
    "* [Wallaroo Pipelines](https://docs.wallaroo.ai/wallaroo-developer-guides/wallaroo-sdk-guides/wallaroo-sdk-essentials-guide/wallaroo-sdk-essentials-pipelines/): Pipelines are used to deploy models for inferencing.  Each model is a **pipeline step** in a pipelines, where the inputs of the previous step are fed into the next.  Pipeline steps can be ML models, Python scripts, or Arbitrary Python (these contain necessary models and artifacts for running a model).\n",
    "* [Pipeline Edge Publication](https://docs.wallaroo.ai/20230300/wallaroo-developer-guides/wallaroo-sdk-guides/wallaroo-sdk-essentials-guide/wallaroo-sdk-essentials-pipelines/wallaroo-sdk-essentials-pipeline-publication/): How to publish a Wallaroo pipeline to an OCI registry, then deploy that pipeline into other environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this tutorial, we will be providing pre-trained models in ONNX format, and have connected a sample Edge Registry to our Wallaroo instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more Wallaroo procedures, see the [Wallaroo Documentation site](https://docs.wallaroo.ai)."

    "\n",
    "Helm deployments take up to two steps - the first step is in retrieving the required `values.yaml` and making updates to override.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Pull the helm charts from the published pipeline.  The two fields are the Helm Chart URL and the Helm Chart version to specify the OCI .    This typically takes the format of:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```bash\n",
    "  helm pull oci://{published.helm_chart_url} --version {published.helm_chart_version}\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Extract the `tgz` file and copy the `values.yaml` and copy the values used to edit engine allocations, etc.  The following are **required** for the deployment to run:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```yml\n",
    "  ociRegistry:\n",
    "    registry: {your registry service}\n",
    "    username:  {registry username here}\n",
    "    password: {registry token here}\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  Store this into another file, suc as `local-values.yaml`.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create the namespace to deploy the pipeline to.  For example, the namespace `wallaroo-edge-pipeline` would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```bash\n",
    "  kubectl create -n wallaroo-edge-pipeline\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Deploy the `helm` installation with `helm install` through one of the following options:\n",
    "    1. Specify the `tgz` file that was downloaded and the local values file.  For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "        ```bash\n",
    "        helm install --namespace {namespace} --values {local values file} {helm install name} {tgz path}\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Specify the expended directory from the downloaded `tgz` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "        ```bash\n",
    "        helm install --namespace {namespace} --values {local values file} {helm install name} {helm directory path}\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Specify the Helm Pipeline Helm Chart and the Pipeline Helm Version.\n",
    "\n",
    "        ```bash\n",
    "        helm install --namespace {namespace} --values {local values file} {helm install name} oci://{published.helm_chart_url} --version {published.helm_chart_version}\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Once deployed, the DevOps engineer will have to forward the appropriate ports to the `svc/engine-svc` service in the specific pipeline.  For example, using `kubectl port-forward` to the namespace `ccfraud` that would be:\n",
