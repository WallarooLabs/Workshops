    "# Workshop Notebook 1: Deploy a Model\n",
    "\n",
    "For this workshop, let's pretend that you work for a real estate company wants to estimate the likely value of their listings portfolio. You have developed a model to predict the sale price of properties that the company has listed, based on data collected in the company's listings database.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this set of exercises, you will used a pre-trained model and deploy it to Wallaroo.  This will require understanding the following concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Wallaroo Workspaces](https://docs.wallaroo.ai/wallaroo-developer-guides/wallaroo-sdk-guides/wallaroo-sdk-essentials-guide/wallaroo-sdk-essentials-workspace/):  Workspaces are environments were users upload models, create pipelines and other artifacts.  The workspace should be considered the fundamental area where work is done.  Workspaces are shared with other users to give them access to the same models, pipelines, etc.\n",
    "* [Wallaroo Model Upload and Registration](https://docs.wallaroo.ai/wallaroo-developer-guides/wallaroo-sdk-guides/wallaroo-sdk-essentials-guide/wallaroo-sdk-model-uploads/): ML Models are uploaded to Wallaroo through the SDK or the MLOps API to a **workspace**.  ML models include default runtimes (ONNX, Python Step, and TensorFlow) that are run directly through the Wallaroo engine, and containerized runtimes (Hugging Face, PyTorch, etc) that are run through in a container through the Wallaroo engine.\n",
    "* [Wallaroo Pipelines](https://docs.wallaroo.ai/wallaroo-developer-guides/wallaroo-sdk-guides/wallaroo-sdk-essentials-guide/wallaroo-sdk-essentials-pipelines/): Pipelines are used to deploy models for inferencing.  Each model is a **pipeline step** in a pipelines, where the inputs of the previous step are fed into the next.  Pipeline steps can be ML models, Python scripts, or Arbitrary Python (these contain necessary models and artifacts for running a model).\n",
    "\n",
    "For this tutorial, we will be providing pre-trained models in ONNX format.  To see how to upload and deploy your particular model, see the [Wallaroo Documentation site](https://docs.wallaroo.ai)."

    "This variable is about to become your best friend - a lot of the commands you'll be running will be through this variable, like `wl.list_workspaces()` to get all of the workspaces available to you in your Wallaroo environment, or `wl.list_models()` to show all of the models in your current workspace.  We'll go into these commands and more - just make sure you saved that Wallaroo client to a variable so you can use it for the other commands.\n",

    "\n",
    "Now we will deploy the pipeline.  Deploying a pipeline allocated resources from the cluster to that pipeline for it's use.  The amount of resources has a default value of 4 CPUs, but for this workshop we'll be adjusting that to just 0.5 cpus and 1 GB RAM per pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **IMPORTANT NOTE**:  Please stick to these resource configurations when using a Wallaroo instance with other users.  Otherwise, pipelines might not deploy if the available resources are used up.\n",

    "\n",
    "* Create a deployment configuration: This is an optional step, but we will make it mandatory for this workshop to allow other users to work in the same Wallaroo instance without running out of resources.\n",
    "* Deploy the pipeline with the deployment configuration:  This is the active step that saves the pipeline steps, and allocates system resources to the pipeline for performing inferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deployment configurations are made with the `wallaroo.DeploymentConfigBuilder()` class, and then we assign the resource settings from there.  This is saved to a variable so we can apply it to our pipeline deployment.\n",
