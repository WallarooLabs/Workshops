ML models include default runtimes (ONNX, Python Step, and TensorFlow) that are run directly through the Wallaroo engine, and containerized runtimes (Hugging Face, PyTorch, etc) that are run through in a container through the Wallaroo engine.\n",
    "* [Wallaroo Pipelines](https://docs.wallaroo.ai/wallaroo-developer-guides/wallaroo-sdk-guides/wallaroo-sdk-essentials-guide/wallaroo-sdk-essentials-pipelines/): Pipelines are used to deploy models for inferencing.  Each model is a **pipeline step** in a pipelines, where the inputs of the previous step are fed into the next.  Pipeline steps can be ML models, Python scripts, or Arbitrary Python (these contain necessary models and artifacts for running a model).\n",
