    "# Workshop Notebook 3: Observability Part 1 - Validation Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous notebooks you uploaded the models and artifacts, then deployed the models to production through provisioning workspaces and pipelines. Now you're ready to put your feet up! But to keep your models operational, your work's not done once the model is in production. You must continue to monitor the behavior and performance of the model to insure that the model provides value to the business.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you will learn about adding validation rules to pipelines.\n",

    "## Preliminaries\n",

    "\n",
    "For convenience, the following `helper functions` are defined to retrieve previously created workspaces, models, and pipelines:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `get_workspace(name, client)`: This takes in the name and the Wallaroo client being used in this session, and returns the workspace matching `name`.  If no workspaces are found matching the name, raises a `KeyError` and returns `None`.\n",
    "* `get_model_version(model_name, workspace)`: Retrieves the most recent model version from the model matching the `model_name` within the provided `workspace`.  If no model matches that name, raises a `KeyError` and returns `None`.\n",
    "* `get_pipeline(pipeline_name, workspace)`: Retrieves the most pipeline from the workspace matching the `pipeline_name` within the provided `workspace`.  If no model matches that name, raises a `KeyError` and returns `None`."

    "## Model Validation Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple way to try to keep your model's behavior up to snuff is to make sure that it receives inputs that it expects, and that its output is something that downstream systems can handle. This can entail specifying rules that document what you expect, and either enforcing these rules (by refusing to make a prediction), or at least logging an alert that the expectations described by your validation rules have been violated. As the developer of the model, the data scientist (along with relevant subject matter experts) will often be the person in the best position to specify appropriate validation rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our house price prediction example, suppose you know that house prices in your market are typically in the range $750,000 to $1.5M dollars. Then you might want to set validation rules on your model pipeline to specify that you expect the model's predictions to also be in that range. Then, if the model predicts a value outside that range, the pipeline will log that one of the validation checks has failed; this allows you to investigate that instance further.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that in this specific example, a model prediction outside the specified range may not necessarily be \"wrong\"; but out-of-range predictions are likely unusual enough that you may want to \"sanity-check\" the model's behavior in these situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wallaroo has functionality for specifying simple validation rules on model input and output values.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "pipeline.add_validation(<rulename>, <expression>)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, `<rulename>` is the name of the rule, and `<expression>` is a simple logical expression that the data scientist **expects to be true**.  This means if the expression proves **false**, then a `check_failure` flag is set in the inference results.\n",
    "\n",
    "To add a validation step to a simple one-step pipeline, you need a handle to the pipeline (here called `pipeline`), and a handle to the model in the pipeline (here called `model`).  Then you can specify an expected prediction range as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Get the pipeline.\n",
    "* Depending on the steps, the pipeline can be cleared and the sample model added as a step.\n",
    "* Add the validation.\n",
    "* Deploy the pipeline to set the validation as part of its steps\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# get the existing pipeline (in your workspace)\n",
    "pipeline = get_pipeline(\"pipeline\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# you also need a handle to the model in this single-step pipeline.\n",

    "\n",
    "**HINT 1**: since the purpose of this exercise is try out validation rules, it might be a good idea to take a small data set and make predictions on that data set first, *then* set the validation rules based on those predictions, so that you can see the check failures trigger.\n",
