    "# Workshop Notebook 2: Vetting a Model With Production Experiments\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we've discussed practices and methods for transitioning an ML model and related artifacts from development to production. However, just the act of pushing a model into production is not the only consideration. In many situations, it's important to vet a model's performance in the real world before fully activating it. Real world vetting can surface issues that may not have arisen during the development stage, when models are only checked using hold-out data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you will learn about two kinds of production ML model validation methods: A/B testing and Shadow Deployments. A/B tests and other types of experimentation are part of the ML lifecycle. The ability to quickly experiment and test new models in the real world helps data scientists to continually learn, innovate, and improve AI-driven decision processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook assumes that you have completed Notebook 1 \"Deploy a Model\", and that at this point you have:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Created and worked with a Workspace.\n",
    "* Uploaded ML Models and worked with Wallaroo Model Versions.\n",
    "* Created a Wallaroo Pipeline, added model versions as pipeline steps, and deployed the pipeline.\n",
    "* Performed sample inferences and undeployed the pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "The same workspace, models, and pipelines will be used for this notebook."

    "## A/B Pipeline Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "An [A/B test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A/B_testing), also called a controlled experiment or a randomized control trial, is a statistical method of determining which of a set of variants is the best. A/B tests allow organizations and policy-makers to make smarter, data-driven decisions that are less dependent on guesswork.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the simplest version of an A/B test, subjects are randomly assigned to either the **_control group_** (group A) or the **_treatment group_** (group B). Subjects in the treatment group receive the treatment (such as a new medicine, a special offer, or a new web page design) while the control group proceeds as normal without the treatment. Data is then collected on the outcomes and used to study the effects of the treatment.\n",
    "\n",
    "In data science, A/B tests are often used to choose between two or more candidate models in production, by measuring which model performs best in the real world. In this formulation, the control is often an existing model that is currently in production, sometimes called the **_champion_**. The treatment is a new model being considered to replace the old one. This new model is sometimes called the **_challenger_**. In our discussion, we'll use the terms *champion* and *challenger*, rather than *control* and *treatment*.\n",
    "\n",
    "When data is sent to a Wallaroo A/B test pipeline for inference, each datum is randomly sent to either the champion or challenger. After enough data has been sent to collect statistics on all the models in the A/B test pipeline, then those outcomes can be analyzed to determine the difference (if any) in the performance of the champion and challenger. Usually, the purpose of an A/B test is to decide whether or not to replace the champion with the challenger.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep in mind that in machine learning, the terms experiments and trials also often refer to the process of finding a training configuration that works best for the problem at hand (this is sometimes called hyperparameter optimization). In this guide, we will use the term experiment to refer to the use of A/B tests to compare the performance of different models in production.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of considerations to designing an A/B test; you can check out the article [*The What, Why, and How of A/B Testing*](https://wallarooai.medium.com/the-what-why-and-how-of-a-b-testing-64471847cd7e) for more details. In these exercises, we will concentrate on the deployment aspects.  You will need a champion model and  at least one challenger model. You also need to decide on a data split: for example 50-50 between the champion and challenger, or a 2:1 ratio between champion and challenger (two-thirds of the data to the champion, one-third to the challenger).\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example of creating an A/B test deployment, suppose you have a champion model called \"champion\", that you have been running in a one-step pipeline called \"pipeline\". You now want to compare it to a challenger model called \"challenger\". For your A/B test, you will send two-thirds of the data to the champion, and the other third to the challenger. Both models have already been uploaded.\n",
    "\n",
    "A/B pipeline steps are created with one of the two following commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `wallaroo.pipeline.add_random_split([(weight1, model1), (weight2, model2)...])`: Create a new A/B Pipeline Step with the provided models and weights.\n",
    "* `wallaroo.pipeline.replace_with_random_split(index, [(weight1, model1), (weight2, model2)...])`: Replace an existing Pipeline step with an A/B pipeline step at the specified index.\n",
    "\n",
    "For A/B testing, pipeline steps are **added** or **replace** an existing step.\n",
    "\n",
    "To **add** a A/B testing step use the Pipeline `add_random_split` method with the following parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Parameter | Type | Description |\n",
    "| --- | --- | ---|\n",
    "| **champion_weight** | Float (Required) | The weight for the champion model. |\n",
    "| **champion_model** | Wallaroo.Model (Required) | The uploaded champion model. |\n",
    "| **challenger_weight** | Float (Required) | The weight of the challenger model. |\n",
    "| **challenger_model** | Wallaroo.Model (Required) | The uploaded challenger model. |\n",
    "| **hash_key** | String(Optional) | A key used instead of a random number for model selection.  This must be between 0.0 and 1.0. |\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that multiple challenger models with different weights can be added as the random split step.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, a pipeline will be built with a 2:1 weighted ratio between the champion and a single challenger model.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "pipeline.add_random_split([(2, control), (1, challenger)]))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Another way to vet your new model is to set it up in a shadow deployment. With shadow deployments, all the models in the experiment pipeline get all the data, and all inferences are recorded. However, the pipeline returns only one \"official\" prediction: the one from default, or champion model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Shadow deployments are useful for \"sanity checking\" a model before it goes truly live. For example, you might have built a smaller, leaner version of an existing model using knowledge distillation or other model optimization techniques, as discussed [here](https://wallaroo.ai/how-to-accelerate-computer-vision-model-inference/). A shadow deployment of the new model alongside the original model can help ensure that the new model meets desired accuracy and performance requirements before it's put into production.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example of creating a shadow deployment, suppose you have a champion model called \"champion\", that you have been running in a one-step pipeline called \"pipeline\". You now want to put a challenger model called \"challenger\" into a shadow deployment with the champion. Both models have already been uploaded. \n",
    "\n",
    "Shadow deployments can be **added** as a pipeline step, or **replace** an existing pipeline step.\n",
    "\n",
    "Shadow deployment steps are added with the `add_shadow_deploy(champion, [model2, model3,...])` method, where the `champion` is the model that the inference results will be returned.  The array of models listed after are the models where inference data is also submitted with their results displayed as as shadow inference results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Shadow deployment steps replace an existing pipeline step with the  `replace_with_shadow_deploy(index, champion, [model2, model3,...])` method.  The `index` is the step being replaced with pipeline steps starting at 0, and the `champion` is the model that the inference results will be returned.  The array of models listed after are the models where inference data is also submitted with their results displayed as as shadow inference results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then creating a shadow deployment from a previously created (and deployed) pipeline could look something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# retrieve handles to the most recent versions \n",
    "# of the champion and challenger models\n",
    "# see the A/B test section for the definition of get_model()\n",
    "champion = get_model(\"champion\")\n",

    "The above code clears the pipeline and adds a shadow deployment. The pipeline will still only return the inferences from the champion model, but it will also run the challenger model in parallel and log the inferences, so that you can compare what all the models do on the same inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can add multiple challengers to a shadow deploy:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "pipeline.add_shadow_deploy(champion, [challenger01, challenger02])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also create a shadow deployment from scratch with a new pipeline.  This example just uses two models - one champion, one challenger.\n",

    "```python\n",
    "newpipeline = wl.build_pipeline(\"pipeline\")\n",
