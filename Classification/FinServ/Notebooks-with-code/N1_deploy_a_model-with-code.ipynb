    "# Workshop Notebook 1: Deploy a Model\n",
    "\n",
    "For this workshop, let's pretend that you work credit card company with a new model that determines if a financial transaction is likely to be fraudulent or not.  You want to deploy this model and use it to examine credit card transactions and return that likelihood, which can be used for approving transactions or requesting further details.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this set of exercises, you will used a pre-trained model and deploy it to Wallaroo.  This will require understanding the following concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Wallaroo Workspaces](https://docs.wallaroo.ai/wallaroo-developer-guides/wallaroo-sdk-guides/wallaroo-sdk-essentials-guide/wallaroo-sdk-essentials-workspace/):  Workspaces are environments were users upload models, create pipelines and other artifacts.  The workspace should be considered the fundamental area where work is done.  Workspaces are shared with other users to give them access to the same models, pipelines, etc.\n",
    "* [Wallaroo Model Upload and Registration](https://docs.wallaroo.ai/wallaroo-developer-guides/wallaroo-sdk-guides/wallaroo-sdk-essentials-guide/wallaroo-sdk-model-uploads/): ML Models are uploaded to Wallaroo through the SDK or the MLOps API to a **workspace**.  ML models include default runtimes (ONNX, Python Step, and TensorFlow) that are run directly through the Wallaroo engine, and containerized runtimes (Hugging Face, PyTorch, etc) that are run through in a container through the Wallaroo engine.\n",
    "* [Wallaroo Pipelines](https://docs.wallaroo.ai/wallaroo-developer-guides/wallaroo-sdk-guides/wallaroo-sdk-essentials-guide/wallaroo-sdk-essentials-pipelines/): Pipelines are used to deploy models for inferencing.  Each model is a **pipeline step** in a pipelines, where the inputs of the previous step are fed into the next.  Pipeline steps can be ML models, Python scripts, or Arbitrary Python (these contain necessary models and artifacts for running a model).\n",
    "\n",
    "For this tutorial, we will be providing pre-trained models in ONNX format.  To see how to upload and deploy your particular model, see the [Wallaroo Documentation site](https://docs.wallaroo.ai)."

We'll go into these commands and more - just make sure you saved that Wallaroo client to a variable so you can use it for the other commands.\n",

    "\n",
    "For Wallaroo instances that enable external endpoints connections to pipelines, each pipeline has it's own URL that can be used to perform inferences through an API call.\n",
    "\n",
    "Performing an inference through an API requires the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The authentication token to authorize the connection to the pipeline.\n",
    "* The pipeline's inference URL.\n",
    "* Inference data to sent to the pipeline - in JSON, DataFrame records format, or Apache Arrow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Full details are available through the [Wallaroo API Connection Guide](https://docs.wallaroo.ai/wallaroo-developer-guides/wallaroo-api-guide/wallaroo-mlops-connection-guide/) on how retrieve an authorization token and perform inferences through the pipeline's API.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this demonstration, we'll use some Wallaroo methods to retrieve those items.  We'll use the `print` command to create the `curl` command to perform an inference on the pipeline deployment URL.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "deploy_url = my_pipeline._deployment._url()\n",
    "\n",
    "headers = wl.auth.auth_header()\n",

    "    --data @{dataFile} > curl_response.df\n",
    "      ''')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You should have an output that looks similar to this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "\n",
    "!curl -X POST https://doc-test.api.wallaroocommunity.ninja/v1/api/pipelines/infer/houseprice-estimator-89/houseprice-estimator \\\n",
