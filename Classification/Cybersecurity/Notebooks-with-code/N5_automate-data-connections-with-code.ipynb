    "# Workshop Notebook 5: Automation with Wallaroo Connections\n",
    "\n",
    "Wallaroo Connections are definitions set by MLOps engineers that are used by other Wallaroo users for connection information to a data source.\n",
    "\n",
    "This provides MLOps engineers a method of creating and updating connection information for data stores:  databases, Kafka topics, etc.  Wallaroo Connections are composed of three main parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Name:  The unique name of the connection.\n",
    "* Type:  A user defined string that designates the type of connection.  This is used to organize connections.\n",
    "* Details:  Details are a JSON object containing the information needed to make the connection.  This can include data sources, authentication tokens, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wallaroo Connections are only used to store the connection information used by other processes to create and use external connections.  The user still has to provide the libraries and other elements to actually make and use the conneciton.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary advantage is Wallaroo connections allow scripts and other code to retrieve the connection details directly from their Wallaroo instance, then refer to those connection details.  They don't need to know what those details actually - they can refer to them in their code to make their code more flexible.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this step, we will use a Google BigQuery dataset to retrieve the inference information, predict the next month of sales, then store those predictions into another table.  This will use the Wallaroo Connection feature to create a Connection, assign it to our workspace, then perform our inferences by using the Connection details to connect to the BigQuery dataset and tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "* A Wallaroo instance version 2023.2.1 or greater.\n",
